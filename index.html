			<h1>Von Neumann Architecture</h1>
			<p>The Von Neumann Model is a computer architecture that was first described in 1945 by the Hungarian physicist John Von Neumann</p>
			<p>The concept of the stored program complete with the Von Neumann Model has powered almost every computer built since then, and only now, more than half a century after it's inception is the architecture starting to be replaced with more modern alternatives. This speaks to the longevity of his genius.</p>
