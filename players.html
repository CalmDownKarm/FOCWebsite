                    <h1>Intel</h1>
                    <img src = "images/intel.png"  class="imagefloats"/>
                    <p> Intel created and sells the x86 computer architecture, that runs most personal computers today. Through successful marketing, its two leading brands - Core and Atom are household names today. Intel is famous for it's Tick-Tock strategy to develop new processors. Wherein, each Tick represents the shrinking of manufacturing technology (The latest tick, Broadwell uses a 14nm fabrication process) and each Tock represents a brand new microarchitecture. Intel releases either a tick or a tock every year or so.
                    Currently Intel is trying to enter the mobile market through it's series of Atom Processors. These are low power processors that are based on a 32nm process.
                    Intel is undoubtedly, one of if not the largest processor manufacturer by Revenue. </p>

                    <h1>AMD</h1>
                    <img src="images/amd.png" class="imagefloats" />
                    <p>Advanced Micro Devices or AMD is a fabless microprocessor company, which means it just designs the chips, but outsources the manufacture to it's spin off corporation Global Foundaries. By merging with the graphics company ATi, the company focuses now on fusing the graphics chipset and the computer processor - this has allowed AMD processors to become popular amongst users who need large amounts of parallelization, such as bitcoin mining. </p>

                    <h1>Qualcomm</h1>
                    <img src="images/qualcomm.png" class="imagefloats"/>
                    <p>Qualcomm creates microprocessors based on the ARM architecture. It is a fabless company, and relies mostly on TSMC for its manufacturing and production. It's famous in the mobile space, and it's line of snapdragon processors power a large percentage of android phones. Currently mobile processors are approaching desktop processors in terms of number of cores, infact, many could say that the rate of development in the mobile platform is significantly faster.  </p>

                <div class="blocktext" id="arm">
                    <h1>ARM</h1>
                    <img src="images/arm_logo.png" class="imagefloats" />
                    <p>ARM is unique in that  not only is it fabless, but also it focuses on licensing it's architecture to different microprocessor companies. They specialize in a 32bit architecture, the processors are extremely popular, because the architecture is licensed by large chip manufacturer's such as Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung etc. Their low power consumption and efficiency has the RISC architecture dominating the mobile space.

                    <h1>Atmel</h1>
                    <img src="images/atmel.png" class="imagefloats" />
                    <p>Atmel is extremely popular in the hobbyist electronics space. Atmel uses AVR architecture as well creating products offering ARM architectures. Atmel microprocessors are used in all sorts of hobbyist electronics projects as well as some commercial embedded systems. AVR architecture has a large ecosystem of predefined code which makes it popular in a non industrial sense</p>
