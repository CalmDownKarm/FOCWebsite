                    <p> Intel created and sells the x86 computer architecture, that runs most personal computers today. Through successful marketing, its two leading brands - Core and Atom are household names today. Intel is famous for it's Tick-Tock strategy to develop new processors. Wherein, each Tick represents the shrinking of manufacturing technology (The latest tick, Broadwell uses a 14nm fabrication process) and each Tock represents a brand new microarchitecture. Intel releases either a tick or a tock every year or so.
                    </p>
                    <p> Currently Intel is trying to enter the mobile market through it's series of Atom Processors. These are low power processors that are based on a 32nm process. </p>
                    <p> Intel is undoubtedly, one of if not the largest processor manufacturer by Revenue. </p>
